# drumpad-v2

## About This Project

**Drumpad 2.0** is a modern recreation and upgrade of my original Drumpad project from high school. The original Drumpad was one of my earliest projects, created between December 2018 and April 2019 as my first official JavaScript project for my high school "Klauzurn√≠ Pr√°ce" (final project). Despite its age, the original project still works to this day!

You can find the old project code here: [github.com/Jakub-Horacek/drumpad](https://github.com/Jakub-Horacek/drumpad)  
It is also being hosted at: [jakub-horacek.github.io/drumpad](https://jakub-horacek.github.io/drumpad/)

This new version, Drumpad 2.0, is built using the Vue 3 framework with TypeScript, bringing the project up to date with modern web development practices. The core idea remains the same: you can play virtual drums by hitting keys, and the app will play corresponding drum sounds. It's a fun and interactive way to experiment with rhythm and sound.

> [!NOTE]  
> Drumpad 2.0 is still in development. Once this version is finished, I will probably archive the old project.

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

## Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vite.dev/config/).

## Key Controls

### Keyboard Shortcuts

- `1-9` or `Numpad 1-9` - Play drum sounds
- `-` or `Numpad -` - Toggle Hi-Hat open/closed
- `+` or `Numpad +` - Toggle Snare/Rimshot
- `Space` - Play/pause recording
- `Shift + Space` - Start/stop recording

### Drum Layout

```

4 - Tom 1    5 - Tom 2    6 - Floor Tom
1 - Hi-Hat   2 - Snare    3 - Kick
```

## Audio Setup

The application uses the Web Audio API for optimal performance. Audio files should be placed in the `public/sounds/` directory with the following naming convention:

```
HIHAT_1.mp3, HIHAT_2.mp3, HIHAT_3.mp3       # Closed hi-hat
HIHAT_O_1.mp3, HIHAT_O_2.mp3, HIHAT_O_3.mp3 # Open hi-hat
SNARE_1.mp3, SNARE_2.mp3, SNARE_3.mp3       # Snare drum
RIMSHOT_1.mp3, RIMSHOT_2.mp3, RIMSHOT_3.mp3 # Rimshot
KICK_1.mp3, KICK_2.mp3, KICK_3.mp3          # Kick drum
TOM1_1.mp3, TOM1_2.mp3, TOM1_3.mp3          # Tom 1
TOM2_1.mp3, TOM2_2.mp3, TOM2_3.mp3          # Tom 2
FLOOR_1.mp3, FLOOR_2.mp3, FLOOR_3.mp3       # Floor tom
CRASH_1.mp3, CRASH_2.mp3, CRASH_3.mp3       # Crash cymbal
SPLASH_1.mp3, SPLASH_2.mp3, SPLASH_3.mp3    # Splash cymbal
RIDE_1.mp3, RIDE_2.mp3, RIDE_3.mp3          # Ride cymbal
```

## Theme System

The application supports multiple themes through CSS custom properties. To add a new theme:

1. Add theme variables in `assets/main.css`
2. Update the theme selector in the settings
3. Themes are automatically applied via CSS classes

Current themes:

- **Dark** (default) - Modern dark interface
- **Light** - Clean light interface (ready for implementation)
- **Cyber** - Neon cyberpunk style (ready for implementation)

## Browser Compatibility

- Chrome 66+
- Firefox 60+
- Safari 14+
- Edge 79+

Requires Web Audio API support for optimal experience.

## Performance Optimizations

- **Audio Preloading** - All sounds loaded at startup
- **Web Audio API** - Low-latency audio processing
- **Component Lazy Loading** - Efficient memory usage
- **Modern Build Tools** - Vite for fast development and optimal production builds
- **Tree Shaking** - Unused code elimination

## Development

### Code Documentation

This project uses **JSDoc** for comprehensive code documentation. All functions, classes, interfaces, and Vue components are documented with:

- Function/class descriptions
- Parameter types and descriptions
- Return value documentation
- Usage examples where helpful
- Type annotations for better IDE support

The documentation follows modern JSDoc standards and provides excellent developer experience with IntelliSense support in most editors.
